# Tech Blog

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a tech blog using handlebars, MySql2, Sequelize, express, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, express-handlebars, and connect-session-sequelize. We began with no code, but I was able to use activities from this unit as a template to get me started. The goal is for the user to be able to create a login, view posts from other users, comment on those post, as well as go to their profile page and view their own posts, delete them and add new posts. This functions as any other blog would. The user's information is stored securley using hashed passwords.

## Installation

Simply download the file from my github repo. After that, open the terminal for the folder that you copied from my repo. Once the terminal is open, type npm install. This will allow you to have all of the necessary packages to run my program (ie. handlebars, MySql2, Sequelize, express, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, express-handlebars, and connect-session-sequelize). You will also need to set up the database using MySQL by going to the db folder and creating the database. After this you can run the command npm run seed to get all the data.

## Usage

Simply go to the Heroku Link provided below.

You could also open the repo and run npm install. Use the command node server.js and go to the route provided. Then follow the webpage.

If you have other Questions you can refer to the video or refer to my GitHub profile.
